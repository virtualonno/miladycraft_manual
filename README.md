# Miladycraft Manual: overview

Welcome to the Miladycraft Manual!\
If you are getting started for the first time, don't worry! A complete installer for both Windows and Mac computers can be downloaded over at:\
[https://miladycraft.net/](https://miladycraft.net/)\
(it also contains the pack file separately, inside a hidden folder, for if you know what you're doing :p)\
\
If you'd like an even simpler, step-by-step guide on how to work with this installer, check out the installation guides for:

* [Windows](miladycraft-installation-guide-windows.md)&#x20;
* Mac (not yet!)
* Linux (not yet either!)

Got into the game? See the [onboarding guide](miladycraft-onboarding-guide.md) for a crash course into some of Miladycraft's most important, fundamental features!

Have other questions? Don't feel afraid to ask other players in-game, or in Milady Village's ([https://discord.gg/milady](https://discord.gg/milady)) Miladycraft channels.



This manual will be updated in the future, so be sure to check back later!
