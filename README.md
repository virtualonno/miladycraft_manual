# Miladycraft Manual: Overview

Welcome to the Miladycraft Manual!

If you are getting started for the first time, don't worry!

A complete installer for both Windows and Mac computers can be downloaded over at:\
[miladycraft.net](https://miladycraft.net/)

(If you're scared, it also contains the pack file separately, inside a hidden folder, for if you know what you're doing :p)\
\
If you'd like an even simpler, step-by-step guide on how to work with this installer, check out the installation guides for:

* [Windows](miladycraft-installation-guide-windows.md)&#x20;
* [Mac](miladycraft-installation-guide-osx.md)
* Linux (good luck nerd!)

Got into the game? See the [onboarding guide](miladycraft-onboarding-guide.md) for a crash course into some of Miladycraft's most important, fundamental features!

Have other questions? Don't feel afraid to ask other players in-game, or in Milady Village's ([https://discord.gg/milady](https://discord.gg/milady)) Miladycraft channels.

This manual will be updated in the future, so be sure to check back later!\
